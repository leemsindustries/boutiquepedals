### Mission
To make extreme pedals accessible and offer something different, experimental, or sometimes even broken sounding while squeezing every ounce of potential from each unique design.

### What makes us unique?
EOFX has the heart of a hipster, if it sounds bad it's good.

### About 
There are plenty of companies out there making pedals. If you're looking for a fantastic "normal" effect, I'll gladly point you in the right direction. Meanwhile, I'll keep plugging away at my little magic boxes. They're wacky, strange, even unhinged and they're... well, pretty good!

Each pedal is wired, soldered, and finished by hand, for now by one person. All one-offs and customs are built on stripboard and truly one of a kind. I'll gladly answer any questions or comments. Feel free to contact me if you have any crazy ideas, pedal fantasies, or custom effect dreams that we can bring to life.

For refined classics look elsewhere, but Emerald Ox has you covered for peculiar possibilities.
