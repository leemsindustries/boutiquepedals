### About 
Radio Mule is a boutique effects pedal manufacturer in Tacoma, WA. A one person shop, all Radio Mule pedals are built by me, in small batches, using high quality components.

I've played electric guitar in Tacoma-area bands for over 15 years, and grew up with an innate curiosity for how things work. I first started tinkering with insides of pedals when I was a teenager-fixing and modifying all the cheap and broken boxes of noise I could get my hands on. Eventually I graduated to building clones of more popular circuits and then to designing my own.

All Radio Mule pedals are designed with a passion for reliability, intuitive usability, and high-quality sound. I hope to see one in the collection of every guitarist, bass player, and general noise enthusiast in the Pacific Northwest.
