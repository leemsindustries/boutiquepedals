### Mission
My original mission was to take over the universe with circuit bent flangers but goals and plans change. Now I'm just trying to share my noisy ideas with like-minded friends. Cat Box Customs is always going to just be me soldering in my basement solo. I'm not trying to trade my eyebrows for fame and fortune, just doing my best to make a little noise of my own 

### What makes us unique?
I have no idea what I'm doing
