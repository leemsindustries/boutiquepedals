### Mission
To provide artists tools to create, as well as a platform to engage around common interests and build community in an artistically stimulated environment.

### What makes us unique?
We build pedals that are expressive in a way that reflects our Sci-Fi approach which navigates a deeper narrative with each character, allowing pedals and fiction to blend together. Our pedals are simple and intuitive to help you instantly create something worth reaching for.

### About 
I've been exploring with pedals for a while now, building out of necessity for my own board like many others have. I love experimenting with parts to get something as unique as possible. I design everything myself from conception to the final product, as well as breadboarding, testing, assembling, and packaging everything by hand. 

I put tons of hours into this because I love it, and I love being a part of the community. I strive to build as good of a product as I can with a uniqueness that is my own and speaks of my experiences.
