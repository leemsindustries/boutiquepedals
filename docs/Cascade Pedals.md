### About 
Thanks for your interest in Cascade Pedals. We are an Asheville, North Carolina based company that specializes in unique, custom guitar effects. While some of these creations may make it to the site, most are up for sale at our Reverb store, at www.reverb.com/shop/cascadepedals . Started in 2017, Cascade Pedals grew out of our founder, Charlie's drive to make a one-of-a-kind pedalboard full of custom pedals. This led to custom requests from local musicians, internet custom orders, the Reverb store, and now our very own line of production pedals! After building dozens of Mostortion clones, we decided to upgrade the circuit around the modern chip to create the Hosstortion.
