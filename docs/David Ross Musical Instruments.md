### Mission
The purpose of my business is to provide unique looking and sounding guitar pedals to people who are serious about music.

### What makes us unique?
In addition to being a guitar pedal manufacturer, I am also a professional guitar repairman who lives and works in Binghamton, New York. I feel that this experience, in addition to being a guitar player since 2004, allows me to focus on making audio effects that look and sound familiar but are not retreads of other guitar pedals in the marketplace.

### About
