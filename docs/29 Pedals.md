### About 
29 Pedals and Believable Audio grew out of a long time audio engineering and tech service where I restored, repaired, and modified equipment alongside work as an audio engineer in studios and on tour. 29 Pedals' first device was EUNA, a boutique-grade input driver that replaces a conventional buffer and provides exceptional headroom, fidelity and line-driving.
