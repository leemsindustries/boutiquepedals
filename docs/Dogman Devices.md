### Website
https://www.dogmandevices.com/

### Mission
Make new and interesting effects to inspire new music and help people make their own tone rather than mimic someone's

### What makes us unique?
Black and worker owned/operated, one person, emphasis on original circuits and experimentation

### About 
I want people to know that for me, this is an art form. I approach building pedals in a way similar to making ceramics or jewelry or any other functional art.
