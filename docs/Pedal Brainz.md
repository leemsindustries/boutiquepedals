### About 
Pedal Brainz are a series of Expression Pedals that can be used manually or controlled with light.

The Left Brain is a computer controlled expression modulator that provides control over patterns of light. The 3rd Eye uses an external photoresistor as an expression controller. The No-Brainer is a hardware configurable manual expression knob.

Everything from simple wave shapes to constrained randomness can be used in-conjunction with the expression input on an effect pedal to create unique and evolving effects.
